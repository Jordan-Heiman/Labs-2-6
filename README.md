# Labs 2 - 6

In the next 5 R computer labs (Labs 2 - 6), you have been charged with developing a conceptual framework for modeling wolf habitat use and selection to identify habitat for wolves as a function of a mix of environmental and 'biotic' variables, some of which we will explore today. These variables include elevation, landcover, human activity, and ungulate habitat suitability. The next 4 (or more) labs will build on each other as we explore the definition of wolf habitat using sample data from the Northern Rockies.

## Version Control with Git, GitHub, and R
